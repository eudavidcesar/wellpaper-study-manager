# wellpaper-study-manager
This is the fire-starting of other projects, or the node other things, which will improving the mode of the students study.

I'm inpired by https://www.iestudos.com.br/, this is realy beautful plataform.

In this plataform we gonna make a step by step to the user can put all entire datas in the localserver. And the local database will go to contain all information like hour, point, excicies, etc.


In the First fase of project i made all parts in browser, to manage all things, we don't have any database or localserver to manipulate data. ()

In the Second fase of project i made a Electro.js application, and it's sincronization with a localdatabase or if the user want, to particular server. And the final user can put your data and save for future.

And the final stage is a browser application, electron browser application and mobile (android in the first). We make all sincronization of data by a server, and make a localdatabase to mantain the atualization, if was made withoutconection.. And anything we want.
